Here is a summary of Chapter 7, "Running Stateful Applications with Kubernetes," from *Mastering Kubernetes, Fourth Edition*:

### **Stateful versus Stateless Applications in Kubernetes**
- **Stateless Applications**: These applications do not manage or persist data within the cluster. Data is often stored in memory or outside the cluster, and containers accessing it are interchangeable.
- **Stateful Applications**: These applications retain data and identity within the Kubernetes cluster. Managing the state within Kubernetes allows automatic scaling, secure operations, and monitoring.
- **Reasons to manage state inside Kubernetes**: Kubernetes offers built-in features for scaling, monitoring, and security.
- **Reasons to manage state outside of Kubernetes**: Using external storage clusters may be suitable if you already have an existing storage setup, or if Kubernetes' support for certain storage clusters is not mature enough.

### **Shared Environment Variables versus DNS Records for Discovery**
Kubernetes provides two main methods for discovering external data stores:
1. **DNS Records**: Pods access storage clusters via stable DNS endpoints.
2. **Environment Variables**: Pods can access configuration data and secrets using environment variables through `ConfigMap` resources. This approach allows injecting environment variables dynamically.

### **StatefulSet Overview**
- **StatefulSets**: Used for stateful applications where maintaining identity and consistent storage is crucial. Pods in StatefulSets have persistent volumes and are managed in a predictable order.
- **When to use StatefulSets**: When applications need consistent network identities, persistent storage, and orderly scaling or deletion.
- **Components**: Include a headless service (for stable DNS names), a pod template, and persistent storage.

### **Running a Cassandra Cluster in Kubernetes**
- **Cassandra Overview**: Cassandra is a distributed, highly available NoSQL database designed for big data.
- **Custom Docker Image**: A specialized Docker image for Cassandra is used to ensure Kubernetes manages its pods efficiently.
- **Headless Service**: Cassandra clusters use headless services for managing node communications without load balancing.
- **StatefulSet for Cassandra**: A StatefulSet is created for managing the Cassandra cluster, ensuring each node has stable network identities and persistent storage.

This chapter explores how Kubernetes' StatefulSet can be used to run complex, stateful applications like Cassandra, emphasizing the importance of ordered deployment and persistent storage.
