Chapter 8, "Deploying and Updating Applications"

### **Live Cluster Updates**
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradual updates to ensure both current and new versions of a service run concurrently. This is easier if components are backward-compatible, and Kubernetes' `Deployment` resource simplifies managing rolling updates. Complex deployments may require compatibility layers when service dependencies are involved.
  
### **Blue-Green Deployments**
In blue-green deployments, two environments (blue and green) are created: the live system (blue) and a new environment (green) with the updated application. Once the green environment is tested, traffic is switched from blue to green. Rolling back is as simple as reverting the traffic switch.

### **Canary Deployments**
Canary deployments are ideal for testing updates in production environments. A small fraction of the user base is exposed to the new version, while most users remain on the stable version. This method helps identify issues early without disrupting the majority of users.

### **Managing Data-Contract Changes and Migrating Data**
Managing changes to data contracts (schemas, payloads, file formats) carefully prevents runtime errors. Data migration, especially for large datasets, requires careful planning and can involve challenges related to scalability and service availability.

### **Deprecating APIs**
Deprecating APIs must be handled with care, particularly for external APIs. Providing client libraries, backward compatibility, and an upgrade guide are best practices to ease the transition.

### **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**
The horizontal pod autoscaler adjusts the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization, such as CPU or custom metrics. The autoscaler can interact with rolling updates, managing deployment versions dynamically based on demand.

### **Handling Scarce Resources with Limits and Quotas**
- **Resource Quotas**: Ensure fair resource allocation by enforcing limits on CPU, memory, and storage consumption. Kubernetes provides different quota types, such as compute resource and storage quotas.
- **Requests and Limits**: Define the minimum and maximum resources required by each pod. This helps ensure that the cluster doesnâ€™t over-provision or under-provision resources.

### **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: CI/CD automates the process of integrating and deploying applications into Kubernetes clusters. Popular tools like Jenkins, GitLab, and custom Kubernetes operators streamline this process.

### **Provisioning Infrastructure for Your Applications**
Kubernetes integrates well with tools like Terraform, Pulumi, and Crossplane for infrastructure provisioning. These tools help automate the deployment and scaling of clusters, integrating with various cloud providers to meet application needs.

This chapter emphasizes efficient deployment strategies, such as rolling updates, autoscaling, and managing resource constraints, while also focusing on continuous delivery best practices.
